# Local Development

Fork the [project](https://github.com/f3ltron/vuepress-component-docgen)

Clone it immediately or with your fork:

```bash
    https://github.com/f3ltron/vuepress-component-docgen
```

As we actually dev with natif nodejs we don't have any transpiler. 
To test the code you can just go in any examples project inside examples folder

and after running 

```bash
npm install
```

run: 

```bash
npm run docs:dev or npm run docs:build
```

And that's all ! You have anything to develop
